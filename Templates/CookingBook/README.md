# CookingBook
This template if based on the LaTeX cookybooky template (https://ctan.org/pkg/cookybooky).

The template was very close to what I was looking for, so I decided to modify it for my needs. Therefore, some functionalities of the original template might have changed or simply gone. I will try to document those changes soon.


## Installation instructions
1. Execute 'latex cookybooky.ins' ; The 'cookybooky.sty' file will automatically be generated as well as a custom's helper file 'myRecipe.cfg' in which custom settings can be setup (or use the pregenerated files in the 'cookybooky' folder);
2. Move the generated file into a directory in the search path by TeX (i.e. \%Documents%\LaTeX\tex\latex\CookingBook\);
3. Try the example file ex_1.tex and see if it works.
