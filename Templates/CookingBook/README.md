# CookingBook
This template is based on the LaTeX `cookybooky` template by JÃ¼rgen Gilg (https://ctan.org/pkg/cookybooky).

The template was very close to what I was looking for, so I decided to modify it for my needs. Therefore, some functionalities of the original template might have changed or simply gone. I will try to document those changes as soon as possible.
Each modification from the original template will be marked as clearly as possible to comply to the *LPPL Version 1.3c* license.


## Installation instructions
1. Execute `latex cookybooky.ins` : The `cookybooky.sty` file will automatically be generated as well as a custom's helper file `myRecipe.cfg` in which custom settings can be setup (or use the pregenerated files in the 'cookybooky' folder);
2. Move the generated file into a directory in the search path by TeX (i.e. `\%Documents%\LaTeX\tex\latex\CookingBook\`);
3. Try the example file ex_1.tex and see if it works.
